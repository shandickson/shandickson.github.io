### README FILE FOR MY PERSONAL WEBSITE 

### Introduction

This repository is where I host my personal site using Quarto and Github Pages. 
I will update this periodically, but please get in touch if you have some queries about myself or my page.

You can view my site here: https://shandickson.github.io/

### CONTENTS

Here I indicate all of the necessary files for my site. Everything is contained within an R project.

##### Explanations

The there are three Quarto documents that make up the main content of my site:

* index.qmd - Home landing page and navigation to internal/external sites
* about.qmd - A brief ramble about myself, my interests, and my skills
* pubs.qmd - A list of publications that is hopefully up to date

Additionally there is:

* _quarto.yml - Some stylistic and structural options for the site
* styles.css - Customising the html templates (currently empty)
* .gitignore - Some files that do not need tracking
* docs - Output directory for rendering the website

There are also some JPEG/PNG images used on the site.
