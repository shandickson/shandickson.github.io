Welcome to my personal page. I never really know what to say about myself but I usually start by telling people I'm Irish, a part-time statistician, part-time sailor, aspiring powerlifter and a top 0.5% Taylor Swift fan 5 years running (according to my Spotify Wrapped).

Over the years, I've dabbled in-and-out of different things in a bid to keep myself entertained. I've found that while *literally everything* is interesting, I always come back to topics around methods and statistics in psychology and health sciences. This led me to my current exercise: a [Research Masters in Methodology & Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl). Now in my final quarter, I'm open to work!

My thesis looks at response rates in surveys and if this directly or indirectly affects bias in survey estimates. Embracing a network modelling perspective, I look at how different survey variables are associated with response rates and/or bias. Response rates are typically considered quite important, but they might not be, so I hope the findings are informative!

On the side, I'm a Research Assistant at the [University Medical Center Utrecht](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl). More of this stuff on my [CV](Shannon.pdf).
