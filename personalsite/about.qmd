Welcome to my personal page. Introductions aren't my strong point, but I usually start by telling people I'm Irish, a researcher, occasional sailor and aspiring powerlifter. 

Over the years, I've dabbled in-and-out of different things in a bid to keep myself entertained. I hold a [MA (Honors) in Psychology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees/index.php?action=programme&code=C802) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), a [Research Masters in Methodology & Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl), and worked as a statistician and (clinical) psychologist in-between these endeavors. 

I am currently a [PhD Candidate in Child and Adolescent Psychology/Psychiatry](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/sophia/research/departments-and-centers/child-psychiatry) at [Erasmus Medical Centre](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/) in Rotterdam. I am just at the beginning, but in 4 years time I hope to have an interesting and useful thesis about early identification of mental health problems in young people. We are using Experience Sampling Methods to track the mood and behaviour of children and adolescents throughout their day, to model risk and resilience for developing problems. My PhD is a one part of a wider flagship effort known as [PROTECt Me](https://convergence.nl/nl/flagship-protect-me/), funded by [Convergence Health and Technology](https://convergence.nl/health-technology/). I am also a member of the [Stress-in-Action Consortium](https://stress-in-action.nl/).

That's not everything, but you can see more of this stuff on my [CV](Shannon.pdf).
